// So the main Intuition behind Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is, 

// The subarray with negative sum is discarded (by assigning max_ending_here = 0 in code).
// We carry subarray till it gives positive sum.


// Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to find the maximum subarray sum in an array of numbers. The algorithm maintains two variables:
